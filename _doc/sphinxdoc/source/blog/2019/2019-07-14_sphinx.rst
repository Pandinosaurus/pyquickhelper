    :epkg:`jupyter_sphinx` was recently updated and now
    includes a directive which lets the user run a piece
    of code and even modify it before running.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        n = 1
        for i in range(1, 10):
            n *= i
            print('i!=%d' % n)

    This kind of complex possibility still surprises me.
    There must be a machine somewhere set up to run something,
    similar to `binder <https://gke.mybinder.org/>`_.

            for i in range(1, 10):
                n *= i
                print('i!=%d' % n)

    Apparently, a button must be added to the page...

        .. thebe-button:: Optional title

    Which gives:

    Let's see if this page works. I don't see a free website
    running python for ever...
