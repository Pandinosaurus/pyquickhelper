    `pdflatex <https://docs.miktex.org/manual/pdftex.html>`_
    does not natively support utf-8 (no fixed size characters) but
    `xelatex <https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/xelatex>`_ does (see
    `Swapping from pdfLaTeX to XeLaTex <https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/385256/swapping-from-pdflatex-to-xelatex>`_).
    I tried a couple of past in the past with no success
    and I finally remove all accents from pdf coming from
    notebooks. It seems to work now.
