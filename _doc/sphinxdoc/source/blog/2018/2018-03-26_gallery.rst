    :title: Long names on Windows

    One of my unit test was failing due to a weird
    error in :epkg:`sphinx-gallery`. The module could not
    write a file on :epkg:`Windows` because its name was longer
    than 260 which still seems to be a limit of the system.

    .. runpython::
        :showcode:

        import sys
        if sys.platform.startswith("win"):
            from ctypes.wintypes import MAX_PATH
            print(MAX_PATH)
        else:
            print('undefined')

    The error was not always happening
    depending on the fact the unit test was run from
    a virtual python environment or not.
    It is difficult to predict that a name will fail
    for a specific installation on a specific platform.
    I forked :epkg:`sphinx-gallery` and made the following
    `modification <https://github.com/sdpython/sphinx-gallery/commit/3ae9f13250cf25c75e1b17b2fade98b7a9940b0d>`_.
    I don't really like it as it should not be needed
    in the first place. I read this blog post
    `Path Tool Long <https://www.burgaud.com/path-too-long>`_
    and discovered the following tool:
    `winrmrf <https://github.com/andreburgaud/winrmrf>`_
    only means to delete very long files. In my case,
    the unit test fails because it tries to create
    a very long name. Other options
    than catching an exception would be to create a long filename
    in Windows or to add it to the souces.
